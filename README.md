# 🛠️ Terraform AWS EC2 Deployment Example

This project demonstrates how to use **Terraform** to provision an **AWS EC2 instance** with an autogenerated SSH key pair. It's designed as an educational example for students learning infrastructure as code (IaC).

---

## 📦 What This Project Does

- Creates an **EC2 key pair** using a locally generated RSA private key.
- Provisions an **EC2 instance** in the `eu-central-1` AWS region.
- Stores the private key locally for SSH access.
- Sets up a **Security Group** allowing SSH (port 22) access from anywhere.
- Outputs the **public IP address** of the instance.

## 🚀 How to Use

> ⚠️ **Pre-requisites**:
> - AWS CLI configured with appropriate IAM credentials
> - Terraform installed (`>= 1.0`)
> - Replace the `vpc_id` in the security group block with a valid VPC ID from your AWS account

1. **Initialize Terraform:**

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

2. **Review the execution plan:**

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

3. **Apply the configuration:**

    ```bash
    terraform apply
